# Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Projects

These are the 5 projects I completed as part of the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/#python-for-everybody) Certification by freeCodeCamp in August 2020.

This certification covered the basics of python, and programming in general. The individual project instructions and explanations can be found in their folders.

My certificate can be found on this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc3f66bd3b-39fe-455f-98a5-b758727953c9/scientific-computing-with-python-v7).
